<h1>Hi there!</h1>
<p>I'm b1uejay (aka Jay) and I'm a student and programmer from the United States who's interested in pretty much anything to do with technology and birds. I'm currently exploring the worlds of software development, IT, and cybersecurity, though I'm also very interested in exploring web development (as you can see I'm currently bad at it) and networking.
